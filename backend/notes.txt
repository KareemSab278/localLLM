i plan to have this run inside vscode locally instead of paying money for copilot. its useless anyway locally

also i need a smaller model to run and maybe i can make it more efficient. anyway i need to go destroy my legs in the gym

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Say hello world in Python", "model": null}'

cant use my pc right now because my hdmi cable is taken for tv lol
